#s:0122|Main laboratory|          20|26|25|27|-1|-1       |LARGE_LAB| You enter a enormous room that seems to be a laboratory. Despite it's              | size you find it kind of empty, with some tables, a connection to the              | reception in the north, and doors in the west, south and east.                     | You find some reports that might contain useful information. It seems              | that you need a special card for opening the west door. The south one is           | partly opened but stuck. The room on the east seems to be a laboratory.            |ILLUMINATED|

It seems like           | they needed to concentrate energy in a small device, which they call               | power core. You still wonder for what did they need the energy.                    |ILLUMINATED|
